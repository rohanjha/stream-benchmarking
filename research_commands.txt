1: testing the out-of-box streaming program
  listening: ./bin/spark-submit --master local[2] examples/src/main/python/streaming/network_wordcount.py localhost 9999
  writing data: nc -l -k 9999

2: testing a setup to test writing to ports
  listening: nc localhost 9999
  writing data: nc -l -k 9999

3: testing the writing to ports (old non-server model)
  listening: nc -l -k 9999
  writing: python write_to_port.py 9999

4: writing from python to spark streaming
  listening: ~/bin/spark-submit --master local[2] network_wordcount.py localhost 9998
  writing: python write_to_port.py 9998

5: writing from python to spark streaming with reasonable output
  listening: ~/bin/spark-submit --master local[2] network_wordcount.py localhost 9998 > output.txt
  writing: python write_to_port.py 9998
  NOTE: also a step of copying the output from spark streaming -- it's currently just output to the shell
