Essentially, Greenhouse has a lookback of m units and a forward prediction
of n units, and when assessing whether a data point is anomalous, the data
point must be compared against the average of the n predictions for that point.
Therefore, a sliding window of size n+m is needed with a movement of one unit
from one window to the next. This implementation is likely possible within
Spark Streaming and might be a productive next step, especially when paired with
a deployed TF model. The performance of the gRPC will be interesting.

An easier system with potentially less overhead might be a CNN that has a
lookback but can output from that lookback whether a datapoint is anomalous.
The window would be smaller in this case, and there would be no predictions to
store.

Windowed programming, however, isn't something I have time to implement at the
moment. It might be a good next step for the project.
